I think we can restore
childhood in the real world.
No smartphone before high school,
no social media till 16,
phone-free schools,
more independence, free play,
and responsibility in the real world,
those four things.
And these are things that we
can all do if we work together,
if we do 'em at the same time.
If we're the only family
that's keeping your kid off
of smartphone till high school
and off of social media till 16,
you're imposing a cost on your child.
And she may be lonely and
she'll say, "Mom, I'm left out."
Now, she might still thank
you, as we saw last night.
So one of the women said
her daughter thanked her
for keeping her off.
But at the time it was painful for her.
And so my hope is, by
spreading these norms,
no parent will ever be
in that position again,
where their kid is the
only one in the class
who doesn't have a smartphone at age 10.
