I have heard that a
short walk after a meal
will reduce blood glucose in
a way that's really dramatic.
Huge amount.
30-35%, just taking a walk
around the block after a meal.
That's definitely a prescription, I think,
everyone should do, 'cause the
research is so strong on it
is that building in simply a
10-minute walk around the block
or a dance party in the kitchen,
moving your muscles for
10 minutes after a meal
can drastically reduce
your glucose response,
'cause you're just
bringing all those channels
to the membrane,
you're taking up the
glucose, you're using it.
It's a whole different physiology
than sitting on the couch after a meal.
That's very high impact.
It's high leverage if it's after a meal.
So highly recommend that.
And the Levels data and
clinical data has shown that out
time and time again.
