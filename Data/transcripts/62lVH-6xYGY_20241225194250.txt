The purpose of the glucose
monitor is curiosity.
It's essentially an MRI for how
all of our different dietary
and lifestyle strategies
are creating this readout
of glucose in our body,
which I think can be really interesting,
and in a world where so many
cards are stacked against us
with diet and lifestyle
and where there's a lot of
confusion about what's right
for us, that can be like very
helpful in actually reducing
the confusion and the
cognitive load of our choices.
We know that keeping your
blood sugar through the course
of a lifetime in a low and
healthy range, so I don't mean up
and down spikes during the day,
but keeping your blood sugar
healthy throughout the course
of your lifetime is
probably the best thing
we can do for longevity.
Staying insulin sensitive,
staying out of the diabetic range.
And so one thing that
the glucose monitor does
for us is just give us more awareness
and agency into like what the trends
of our glucose are over time, as opposed
to a literally one data
point snapshot once a year
in the doctor's office,
which is what the majority
of us are used to.
