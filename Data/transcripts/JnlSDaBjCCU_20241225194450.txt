Is going to failure
more effective than not going to failure?
It's going to generate a
lot of discussion in the
comments, I can't wait to see it.
So, I'm going cite quite a bit of work
from my powerlifting coach, Zac Robinson,
because he is at FAU,
just finished his PhD,
and did a lot of meta-regressions
and meta-analyses on this exact topic.
So, I'll give you the answers first
that are straight down the
line scientific answers,
and then I'll explain things.
For muscular hypertrophy, you
need to get close to failure,
but you probably don't
need to train to failure
to maximize hypertrophy, but
you've got to get pretty close.
You can be stronger, but
to maximize strength,
you're probably better off not
touching failure very often.
So, there are a few studies
now looking at this,
showing that I think there
was one study recently,
and I can't remember the exact details,
but that I remember it
being pretty well-designed.
And the takeaway was hypertrophy
was similar between the groups,
but the group that went to failure
or stayed a few reps shy of failure
actually got stronger
compared to the group
that was taking most sets to failure.
And did they control for total
volume of work-
Yes, so.
Okay, 'cause I can imagine
not goin' to failure,
you can do more sets, because you've got.
And that's exactly-
More quote unquote
gas in the tank, right?
And practically, that may
be a benefit of stopping
shy of failure, right?
But yeah, they control
for those variables,
so when we talk about
volume, the way we define
that is essentially number of hard sets,
which a hard set would be
a set close to failure.
The general consensus
is within five reps of failure
is considered a hard set.
Now, what I will tell people
is that may not sound like much,
most people have never truly
pushed themselves to failure.
