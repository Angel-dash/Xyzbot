Don't make it like,
"We're going to take away
all this stuff from you.
Ha ha ha, now you have nothing to do."
Make it more like, "I'm not
trying to hurt you here.
I want you to have fun the way I did
and the way your grandparents did.
We all had human childhoods
full of adventure.
I want that for you."
And I think most Gen Z will embrace that.
They just don't want to do it alone.
So the key is, if you're
listening to this podcast
and if you have kids
that are in elementary
and middle school, be sure
to talk with the parents
of your kids' friends.
So if you want to make some changes
in your phone policies, if
four families do it together,
now your kid's not going to
feel left out or deprived
and be sure to give them something.
Give them, say, "Here,
you know what every,
how about every Friday?
Let's call it Free Play Friday.
No piano lessons on Friday.
No nothing on Friday."
Fridays, you all get together.
You can start at anyone's
house. Go out, do what you want.
We'll give you, you know,
we'll give you more allowance
or we'll give you money to spend,
but go have experiences.
Then it's fun. It's not deprivation.
