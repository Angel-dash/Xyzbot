When we think about the people
who create the conditions
for us to be our true selves,
we don't think about the wisest, smartest,
fixer, problem solver.
We think about the non-judgmental listener
who shows compassion.
I think that has to be reinforced,
that some of the fear that we have
is that we're going to get
lost in all these feelings.
But no one's asking you to
get lost in their feelings.
What they're asking for is support.
They're asking you to just listen
and to maybe ask me a few questions
to help me clarify my experience
and then help me on a path
towards feeling better.
