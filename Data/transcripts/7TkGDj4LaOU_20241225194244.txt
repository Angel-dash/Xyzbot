Two benefits that I find from fasting.
Number one, calorie restriction.
Number two, bowel rest.
Many individuals have
gastrointestinal challenges.
When they're in a time-restricted window,
they're not feeding all day long.
Great point.
And those are the two
benefits that I often see.
An individual who is older or
struggling to put on muscle,
fasting would not be my primary go-to.
I think that as individuals age,
there's a bit of a negative
because you have to balance
this muscle protein synthesis.
They're always going through a synthesis
and a catabolism.
So an an anabolic process
and a catabolic process.
As you age, it becomes more difficult
to regulate that process.
And if you add in additional fasting,
go through long periods of time
where let's say you're not training,
you're not protecting skeletal tissue,
that would be a place
where I don't necessarily
recommend fasting.
