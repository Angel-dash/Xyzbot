There any evidence that one's
bodily position during sleep
or the orientation of the
feet relative to the head,
you know, the angle
elevated upward or downward,
has any impact on the pattern
of different sleep stages
or quality or any other aspects of sleep?
There is a reason for it.
And we'll probably come
onto this at some point
when we speak about different
methods for sleep optimization
or the new wave of fascinating
sleep enhancement tools,
has to do with temperature, we think.
That for you to be able to
fall asleep and stay asleep,
you have to drop your
brain and body temperature
by just a little less than
about one degree Celsius,
or probably two, two and
a half degrees Fahrenheit.
And that's the reason by the way,
that you will always find
it easier to fall asleep
in a room that's too cold than too hot,
because the room that's too
cold is at least taking you in
the right temperature
direction for good sleep.
