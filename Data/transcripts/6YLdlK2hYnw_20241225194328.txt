I don't want to use the word happy.
I want to see you joyful.
Joy.
Joy is more important than happiness.
Joy is a state of mind.
Happiness is okay,
yeah, I said a list of
things I want to have,
and I have them, and I smile a lot.
Joyfulness is this sense
of being in yourself,
and I would like that.
I would personally like
to see you enjoying today
and this weekend, and that's it,
and everything else is
going to come to you.
