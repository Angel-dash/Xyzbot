Does one need to worry about
one kind of dizzy inducing
head hit from everyday life?
You know, I think a lot of
people are kind of scared,
like, do they do brain damage?
Or is the evolutionary adaptation
which is the thick skull
sufficient to, you know,
keep us safe in most cases.
I don't think you need
to worry in general,
especially if your symptoms resolve
within a relatively short period of time.
Such as, how long?
A day or two?
Yeah, I mean, you know, even
if you have a mild concussion
and you recover within a day or two,
I don't think there's any
need to worry or get a scan,
and it's a commonplace occurrence.
Yeah, I think your answer
will set a lot of minds at
ease because people do worry.
I mean, there's something so
mysterious about the stuff
that occurs inside the cranial vault.
We can't look to something.
We can't, you know, take our pulse.
It's just, you know, it's so hard to know
what's going on in there.
Well, as you say, that's why
we develop very thick skulls
to protect the most important organ.
