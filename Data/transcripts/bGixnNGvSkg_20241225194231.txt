Is it true that microwave safe means,
it just means that the plastic
won't melt in the microwave,
but it's...
Never, never put plastic in a microwave.
So here's the story.
The BPA, phthalates, plasticizers
are added to the plastic,
but they're not chemically
bound to it, okay?
So if you put anything in a container
that has these chemicals in it, they will,
and then put it in a hot environment,
they will come out of the
plastic and go into the food.
So if you, in a microwave, or
you put your bottle in the car
and the sun comes in and
it warms up the bottle,
and then the stuff goes into your water.
You don't want to mix these
chemicals and your food,
but if you do,
the worst thing is to do
it in a heated environment.
