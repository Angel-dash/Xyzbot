When it comes to reducing BPA exposure
and some of these forever
chemicals that you mentioned,
seems like reducing fluid intake
from plastic vessels
is going to be number one.
The primary source of BPA
is in the lining of cans.
So any drink, or soup, or
anything that comes in a can.
Any can, all cans?
Any can, unless it's a high-end,
you know, elite company
that's made the change from
BPA to an alternative lining,
and they'll say that.
So, and by the way,
BPA has some bad relatives
such as BPS and BPF.
And maybe you'd be
interested in this story.
So when it came out
that BPA was estrogenic,
which is what it is.
And by the way,
it's kind of the evil twin of
phthalates because phthalates
are anti-androgenic and BPA is estrogenic,
and phthalates make plastic
soft and BPA makes plastic hard.
You don't want either, okay.
So when this came out
that this was a bad thing,
the manufacturer started selling
things that say BPA-free.
I'm sure you've seen that.
The trick is that instead
of BPA, they use BPS.
Sneaky rats.
And BPF.
That's so sneaky.
And these are chemicals,
these are lookalikes,
they're analogs, and
they're just as harmful.
