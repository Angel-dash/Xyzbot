Let's talk about oral health.
Most all, not all, but
most, all mouthwashes,
especially those containing alcohol,
are terrible for oral health.
No specific food, not even
sugar, causes cavities.
Cavities are caused by
bacteria that feed on sugar.
The real big question
with toothpaste is always,
should I use a toothpaste
that has fluoride,
or avoid toothpastes that have fluoride?
Some people, I remember
this in college, would say,
"Oh, you know, if you've got a, you know,
"you've got a, like scratch,
in the back of your throat,
"you're getting sick, you
know, you should drink."
And that's what they said,
"You should drink, it's going
to kill that thing off."
Well, guess what?
It does the exact opposite.
So xylitol is a very potent
tool for improving oral health.
So I strongly suggest
that all of us take a look
at what we are currently doing
for our tooth and oral health,
and consider what
modifications are best for us.
