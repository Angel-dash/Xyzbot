"Every night, for some
strange reason at 2:45 AM,
I wake up, and it happens
three or four nights a week."
My first question to them is,
"How do you know it's 2:45?" [chuckling]
And they say, "Well, I look at the clock,"
or "I look at my phone."
Best piece of advice next,
remove all clock faces from the bedroom.
No matter how bad your sleep
is going to be that night,
knowing what time it is,
is only going to make matters worse.
It is not going to make
matters any better.
And that can create an anxiety trigger
that you think it's 2:45,
and then you are tossing and turning.
You look back at the
clock and now it's 3:14 AM
and you think, "I've
got to be awake at 6:00.
I've got that big meeting."
And now it's 5:25.
Don't do that to yourself.
