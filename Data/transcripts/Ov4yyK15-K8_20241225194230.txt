Did you ever walk up to your buddy
and say, "You know, my arm really hurts.
You know, I injured it the other day."
And what did your buddy do?
They'd stomp on your foot.
And you'd say, "Why the
heck did you do that?"
You and I must have grown
up with the same friends.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And they'd say, well, "Now,
doesn't your arm feel better?"
And I'd be like, "Well, yeah, it does."
And yeah, I did grow
up with those friends.
I tell this story to some people
and I sometimes just
get the wide eyes like,
"They did what?"
Yeah, we are not making
recommendations here.
No, we're not making recommendations,
but it's a real phenomenon.
It was described by Le Bars late '70s,
'78 or something like that,
in rodent models initially.
And what happens is that when you engage
a nociceptive stimulus
or a painful stimulus in a site distal
different from where the primary pain is,
it engages a brainstem circuit
that has descending pathways
to the spinal cord and inhibits pain.
Amazing.
Pain inhibits pain. It works.
