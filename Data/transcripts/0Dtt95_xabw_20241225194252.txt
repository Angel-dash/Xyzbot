So it's very clear that smoking,
vaping, dipping or snuffing
is bad for skin appearance and health.
Bad, bad, bad.
Every dermatologist said this.
Why?
Well, with smoking, you
can imagine why, okay?
A lot of carcinogens
and toxic end products
generated from smoking,
even from vaping.
Yes, even from vaping,
it will make your skin
age faster, that's clear.
But it's also the substance itself.
Why all of those things,
in addition to increasing inflammation,
nicotine itself is a vasoconstrictor,
so you're doing the exact
opposite of what you want
when it comes to skin
health and appearance.
And that's why people
take things like BPC-157,
that's why people take nicotinamide,
that's why people are trying to improve
the hydration status of their skin.
So if you're somebody
that's vaping nicotine,
or even taking nicotine
in some other form,
pouch or smoking nicotine,
and you're interested in
having youthful-appearing skin,
you are really shooting yourself
in the, I don't know, face?
