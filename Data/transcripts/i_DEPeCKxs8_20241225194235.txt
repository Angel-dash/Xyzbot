There are really no other
animal species in the world
that have obesity and
chronic disease epidemics.
And they don't have social media,
they don't have experts,
they don't have PubMed,
they don't have the FDA,
they don't have the USDA.
They don't have any of it,
and they have somehow figured out a way
to stay at a healthy weight
and to not get heart disease.
And it's because they're eating real food
that meets the needs of their cells.
The root cause of the problem
is that we have a toxic food supply
that's no longer filled with
the molecular information
that our body needs to know to be satiated
and to function properly.
And so through the complex biology
of satiety hormones and neurobiology
and microbiome function,
we are driven to eat
so, so, so much more.
So, truly, the jumping-off point
for anyone on the quest to better health
is to eat as much real, unprocessed food
from good soil as possible.
